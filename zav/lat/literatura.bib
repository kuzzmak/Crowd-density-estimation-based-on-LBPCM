    abstract = { This study analyzed properties and characteristics of pedestrian flow on sidewalks. Data were collected in the central business district of Haifa, Israel, with the aid of a videotape recorder and a digital clock. Walking speeds for men were found to be significantly greater than speeds for women; all speeds were found to be inversely related to densities. One‐ and three‐regime linear speed‐density regression models were calibrated and evaluated, and reasoning is given to support the adoption of the three regime model for speed predictions. Level of service definitions are proposed based on these analyses, and suggestions for their use in planning and design of pedestrian walkways are made. }
